Instructions to Build, Run and Test your Project:
-------------------------------------------------
"make compile" then "make run" or just "make run" will build and run the program. "make" also will do so.

"make test" will build and run the available test classes for the project. 
**Frontend tests have yet to be completed, will be submitted later**

Instructions for using program: 
When program is initialized, it will welcome user. 
User then presses "Enter" to go into Search Selection Mode

 Search Selection Mode:
This acts as a main menu where the user can choose how they want to search the catalog. 
If they wish to search by a player's career points, press 1.
If they wish to search by a player's name, press 2. 

 Search By Points: 
By pressing 1, user will enter search by points mode. 
Here they can enter a points value, and the program will retrieve the player and their stats. 
For example, entering 38387 will retrieve Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his career statistics. 

 Search By Name: 
By pressing 2, user will enter search by name mode. 
If they enter a player's name with proper capitilization and spacing, 
program will retrieve player with that name and their career stats. 
For example, entering "Giannis Antetokounmpo" (not "Giannis" or "Antetokounmpo") will return
that player and their career stats. 

Team Member Contributions:
--------------------------
No one failed to meet expectations. 
All of them went beyond to help make sure things were on track as I had a family emergency over the weekend.
Each of them made sure to have their portions of the project completed for the deadline.
Yuven helped with some last minute bugs, which helped completion happen faster.
Reno similar to last time also helped whenever anyone had any questions.
Mayank was helpful with getting the team together to go over the project.
