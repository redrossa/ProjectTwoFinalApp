Frontend Instructions: 
When program is initialized, it will welcome user. 
User then presses "Enter" to go into Search Selection Mode

 Search Selection Mode:
This acts as a main menu where the user can choose how they want to search the catalog. 
If they wish to search by a player's career points, press 1.
If they wish to search by a player's name, press 2. 

 Search By Points: 
By pressing 1, user will enter search by points mode. 
Here they can enter a points value, and the program will retrieve the player and their stats. 
For example, entering 38387 will retrieve Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his career statistics. 

 Search By Name: 
By pressing 2, user will enter search by name mode. 
If they enter a player's name with proper capitilization and spacing, 
program will retrieve player with that name and their career stats. 
For example, entering "Giannis Antetokounmpo" (not "Giannis" or "Antetokounmpo") will return
that player and their career stats.
